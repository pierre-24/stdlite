 * Structure that represent a (closed-shell!) wavefunction.

 * Thus, it contains geometrical information, as well as the `S` (overlap), `C` (LCAO coefficients), and `e` (MO energies) matrices.
 * It is assumed that the MO are ordered in increasing energy values, and thus that electrons sits on the lower levels.
 *
 * Note: this structure takes about `(3 * natm + nmo + nao * (nao + nmo)) * sizeof(double) + nao * sizeof(size_t)` bytes of space when correctly allocated.
