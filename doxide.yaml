title: Public API documentation
description: |
  This section describes the public API of `libstdlite`.
  
  ## Basic principles
  
  Every object, enum, or function that belongs to the public library API starts with `stdl_`.
  
  The user is required delete all objects created within the library by using the provided deletor functions to avoid memory leaks.
  
  Except for constructors, each function return an error code (see [error codes](./errors/stdl_error_code_)) or `STDL_ERR_OK` if everything went well. 
  
  For example,
  
  ```c
  #include <stdlite/utils/base_parser.h>
  
  int an_integer;
  FILE* f = open("tmp.txt");
  
  if(f != NULL) {
    stdl_lexer* lexer = stdl_lexer_new(f); // creator
  
    if(lexer != NULL) {
      if(stdl_parser_get_integer(lx, &an_integer) == STDL_ERR_OK) {
        printf("read: %d\n", an_integer);
      }
    
      stdl_lexer_delete(lx); // deletor
    }
    
    fclose(f);
  }
  ```

      Handling of errors and error messages.
      
      ```c
      #include <stdlite/errors.h>
      ```
      
      Also contains function to signal warnings and debug messages.
      
      By default `DEBUG_LVL=1`, which allows errors and warnings to be printed. 
      To shut down every messages, use `stdl_set_debug_level(-1)`.

          Basic parser utilities to extract strings, integers, and real numbers from files.

        title: FCHK parser
        description: |
          Parser for FCHK files generated by Gaussian.
          FCHK stands for *formatted checkpoint*, for which the format is better described in the "Fchk file" tab of [this page](https://gaussian.com/interfacing/).
          
          ```c
          #include <stdlite/utils/fchk_parser.h>
          ```
          
          While this parser contains some safeguards, it works better if the FCHK is correctly formatted.
          
          !!! warning
          
              The logical type, `L`, is not implemented. However, it does not seems to be used in production FCHK.
              Scalar `C` is also not implemented nor used.
