title: Public API documentation
description: |
  This section describes the public API of `libstdlite`.
  
  ## Basic principles
  
  + Unless otherwise mentioned, everything inputs and outputs are (to be) given in [atomic units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_units) (of energy [hartree], of length [bohr], etc).
  
  + Every object, enum, or function that belongs to the public library API starts with `stdl_`.
  
  + (?) Every array is stored in the usual [**row major**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order) form rather than the usual in fortran, column major.
    That mean that calling to BLAS/LACPACK, one should use the flag to specify that the matrices should be transposed (*i.e.*, `C`).
  
  + The user is required delete all objects created within the library by using the provided deletor functions to avoid memory leaks.
    Furthermore, each function return an error code (see [error codes](./errors/stdl_error_code_)) or `STDL_ERR_OK` if everything went well. 
    For example,
    
    ```c
    #include <stdlite/utils/base_parser.h>
    
    int an_integer, error;
    stdl_lexer* lexer = NULL;
    FILE* f = open("tmp.txt");
    
    if(f != NULL) {
      if(stdl_lexer_new(&lexer, f) == STDL_ERR_OK) {
        if(stdl_parser_get_integer(lx, &an_integer) == STDL_ERR_OK) {
          printf("read: %d\n", an_integer);
        }
      
        stdl_lexer_delete(lexer); // deletor
      }
      
      fclose(f);
    }
    ```

    title: Basis set
    description: |
      Describe a set of basis functions, centered on atoms.
      
      ```c
      #include <stdlite/basis.h>
      ```
      
      Follows the structure of [`libcint`](https://github.com/sunqm/libcint/blob/master/doc/program_ref.txt), so that it can be used to compute extra integrals.
      
      !!! note
          
          Most of the documentation (and all examples) of libcint actually refers to the old (version < 3.0) API.
          The new API actually includes two extra parameters [described there](https://github.com/sunqm/libcint/blob/master/doc/program_ref.tex#L228).
  - name: errors
    title: Error definition and handling
    description: |
      Handling of errors and error messages.
      
      ```c
      #include <stdlite/errors.h>
      ```
      
      Also contains function to signal warnings and debug messages.
      
      By default `DEBUG_LVL=1`, which allows errors and warnings to be printed. 
      To shut down every messages, use `stdl_set_debug_level(-1)`.

          Basic parser utilities to extract strings, integers, and real numbers from files.

      - name: fchk_parser
        title: FCHK parser
        description: |
          Parser for the FCHK files generated by Gaussian.
          FCHK stands for *formatted checkpoint*, for which the format is described in the "FChk File" tab of [this page](https://gaussian.com/interfacing/).
          
          ```c
          #include <stdlite/utils/fchk_parser.h>
          ```
          
          While this parser contains a few safeguards, it works better if the FCHK is correctly formatted.
          
          !!! warning
          
              The logical type, `L`, is not implemented. However, it does not seems to be used in production FCHK.
              Scalar `C` is also not implemented nor used.
          
          In order to parse a FCHK, use something of the form:
          
          ```c
          char* name = NULL;
          char type;
          int error, is_scalar;
          
          // 1. Open file, create lexer
          FILE* f = fopen("file.fchk", "r");
          stdl_lexer* lx = stdl_lexer_new(f);
          
          // 2. Skip intro
          stdl_fchk_parser_skip_intro(lx);
          
          // 3. Read sections
          while (lx->current_tk_type != STDL_TK_EOF) {
            // read section info, giving:
            // a) the name of the section, b) its type, and c) if it is a scalar
            error = stdl_fchk_parser_get_section_info(lx, &name, &type, &is_scalar);
            
            if(error == STDL_ERR_OK) {
              if(strcmp("an interesting section", name) == 0) {
                /* Read the content of this section by using either:
                 * - `stdl_fchk_parser_get_scalar_*()`, or
                 * - `stdl_fchk_parser_get_vector_*()`.
                 * Don't forget to free the result after use.
                 */
              } else if(/* ... */) {
                /* ... */
              } else {
                // not interesting, skip section
                stdl_fchk_parser_skip_section(lx, type, is_scalar);
              }
              free(name);
            }
          }
      
          stdl_lexer_delete(lx);
          fclose(f);
          ```
